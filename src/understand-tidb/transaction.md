# Transaction

The transaction engine in TiDB is responsible to provide the `ACID` guarantee for all the read and write requests. It's consisted of the client/coordinator part in `tidb` repository and the server/participant part in `tikv` repository. This document is mainly about the `tidb` part.

# The Architecture

In `TiDB` the transaction write flow is like this:

![transaction-architecture](../img/transaction-architecture.png)

After the transaction is started in a session, all the reads and writes will use a snapshot to fetch data, and the write content will be buffered in the memory buffer
of the transaction. When the `commit` statement is received from the client, the `percolator` protocol will be used to persist these changes to the storage system.

# The Interface

In `tidb`, the [Transaction](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/kv/kv.go#L181) interface defines the commonly used transaction operations.
```
type Transaction interface {
  ...
	// Commit commits the transaction operations to KV store.
	Commit(context.Context) error
	// Rollback undoes the transaction operations to KV store.
	Rollback() error
	// LockKeys tries to lock the entries with the keys in KV store.
	// Will block until all keys are locked successfully or an error occurs.
	LockKeys(ctx context.Context, lockCtx *LockCtx, keys ...Key) error
	// SetOption sets an option with a value, when val is nil, uses the default
	// value of this option.
	SetOption(opt int, val interface{})
	// GetOption returns the option
	GetOption(opt int) interface{}
	...
	// StartTS returns the transaction start timestamp.
	StartTS() uint64
	// Valid returns if the transaction is valid.
	// A transaction become invalid after commit or rollback.
	Valid() bool
	// GetMemBuffer return the MemBuffer binding to this transaction.
	GetMemBuffer() MemBuffer
	// GetSnapshot returns the Snapshot binding to this transaction.
	GetSnapshot() Snapshot
  ...
}
```

[LazyTxn](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/session/txn.go#L50) is a wrapper of the transaction implementations, when the SQL statements are executed in a session context, `LazyTxn` will be used to do things likeï¼š
- Return the memory buffer for write.
- Set specific operations or flags for the current transaction.
- Return the snapshot of this transaction.
- etc...

# The Statement Execution

Usually the first thing that will be done executing a statment is to `activiate` the related transaction in its session. By default `TiDB` proviedes the snapshot isolation level so in each new transction, a new global strong snapshot will be fetched first before executing statements. In `tidb` the snapshot is repsented by a global tso which is fetched from the `pd` server, and it acts as the unique idetifier for this transaction. After this operation a transaction is regarded as `activated`.

For the read SQL statements, the [snapshot](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/driver/txn/snapshot.go) will be used to provide a global strong consistent snapshot, all the reads will check data visibility using this snapshot. Most executors will set the timestamp doing the build, and the transaction could be activiated by the building process. Some commonly used [snapshot](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/driver/txn/snapshot.go#L40) API:
```
// BatchGet gets all the keys' value from kv-server and returns a map contains key/value pairs.
// The map will not contain nonexistent keys.
func (s *tikvSnapshot) BatchGet(ctx context.Context, keys []kv.Key) (map[string][]byte, error) {
	data, err := s.KVSnapshot.BatchGet(ctx, toTiKVKeys(keys))
	return data, extractKeyErr(err)
}

// Get gets the value for key k from snapshot.
func (s *tikvSnapshot) Get(ctx context.Context, k kv.Key) ([]byte, error) {
	data, err := s.KVSnapshot.Get(ctx, k)
	return data, extractKeyErr(err)
}
```

For the write SQL statements, they will write data into the transaction memory buffer temporarily until the `commit` operations is triggered. There are 3 main interfaces which will write query data into the memory buffer, they are the [tables](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/table/table.go#L166) API:
```
// Table is used to retrieve and modify rows in table.
type Table interface {
	...
	// AddRecord inserts a row which should contain only public columns
	AddRecord(ctx sessionctx.Context, r []types.Datum, opts ...AddRecordOption) (recordID kv.Handle, err error)

	// UpdateRecord updates a row which should contain only writable columns.
	UpdateRecord(ctx context.Context, sctx sessionctx.Context, h kv.Handle, currData, newData []types.Datum, touched []bool) error

	// RemoveRecord removes a row in the table.
	RemoveRecord(ctx sessionctx.Context, h kv.Handle, r []types.Datum) error
	...
}
```

Every statement will use a `staging buffer` during its execution, if it's successful the staging content will be merged into the transaction memory buffer. For example `AddRecord` will try to write an row into the current statement staging buffer, and the `RemoveRecord` will try to remove an row in the staging statement buffer. The transaction memory buffer will not be affected if the statement has failed.

The memory buffer implementation is wrapped in [memBuffer](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/driver/txn/unionstore_driver.go#L27). The internal implementation is `MemDB` object.
